# Backend App

## Overview
The Backend app serves as the core module for shared utilities and common functionalities across the MoveMentor project. It is a default Django app that provides foundational support for other feature-specific apps.

## Structure

- **__init__.py:** Marks this directory as a Python package.
- **admin.py:** Registers any shared models for admin access.
- **apps.py:** Configuration for the backend app.
- **models.py:** Contains base models and abstract classes for reuse.
- **tests.py:** Unit tests for shared functionality.
- **views.py:** Houses shared view logic or helper functions.
- **migrations/:** Manages database schema migrations for shared models.

## Future Plans
- **Utility Enhancements:** Expand helper functions and utilities for broader reuse.
- **Middleware and Context Processors:** Implement custom middleware to streamline common processes.
- **Refactor Shared Logic:** Consolidate overlapping functionality from other apps as needed.
