# Analytics App

## Overview
The Analytics app handles movement data processing, form analysis, and performance metrics within the MoveMentor project. It processes raw position data into actionable insights about exercise form and technique.

## Structure

- **__init__.py:** Marks this directory as a Python package.
- **admin.py:** Registers analytics models for the Django admin interface.
- **apps.py:** Configuration for the analytics app.
- **models.py:** Contains models for position tracking and movement analysis.
- **tests.py:** Unit tests for analytics functionality.
- **views.py:** Handles data processing and visualization requests.

## Models

### BodySegmentPosition
Tracks 3D position and orientation of body segments during exercise.

### ExerciseAnalysis
Aggregates metrics for each exercise set, including segment ranges and composite scores.

## Future Plans
- **Advanced Form Analysis:** Implement more sophisticated algorithms for form assessment.
- **Real-time Feedback:** Develop real-time form correction capabilities.
- **Machine Learning Integration:** Train models for personalized form analysis.
- **Visualization Dashboard:** Create interactive visualizations of movement patterns.
- **Trend Analysis:** Add long-term progress tracking and trend identification.
- **services/:** Directory for analytical processing services.
  - **position_processor.py:** Processes raw position data.
  - **form_analyzer.py:** Analyzes exercise form.
