# Analytics App

## Overview
The Analytics app is designed to handle data aggregation, reporting, and visualization tasks within the MoveMentor project. Currently, it has the default Django structure and minimal functionality.

## Structure

- **\_\_init\_\_.py:** Marks this directory as a Python package.
- **admin.py:** Enables registration of models in the Django admin interface.
- **apps.py:** Defines the configuration for the analytics app.
- **models.py:** Houses database models for analytics data.
- **tests.py:** Contains unit tests for analytics features.
- **views.py:** Handles HTTP requests and responses related to analytics functionality.
- **migrations/:** Stores migration files that track database schema changes.

## Future Plans

- **Data Aggregation and Analysis:** Implement logic to process workout, user, and resource data for meaningful insights.
- **Reporting and Visualization:** Generate interactive dashboards or reports (potentially integrating with Dash or another visualization tool).
- **Integration with Other Apps:** Leverage data from workouts, users, and resources to provide a unified analytics experience.
